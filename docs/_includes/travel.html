			<h3>Location</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-8">
			<p>Los Alamos is our home (and Benigno's hometown). It's about 40 minutes north of Santa Fe, 1 hour 45 minutes north of Albuquerque, and 6 hours south of Denver. Albuquerque International Sunport is the closest major airport, and Santa Fe Regional Airport also offers some flights.</p>
			<p>At 7,200 feet above sea level, Los Alamos is 2,000 feet higher than Denver! Take it easy and drink plenty of water. Be aware that altitude increases the effects of alcohol (including the next morning...) for many people.</p>

			If you ask us, northern New Mexico is the most beautiful place in the world. The 1000-year-old cliff dwellings of <a href="https://www.nps.gov/band/index.htm">Bandelier National Monument</a> are a few minutes away. There are tons of <a href="https://losalamosnm.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=6435810&pageId=6919411">hiking trails in Los Alamos</a> and in the nearby Jemez mountains (the <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/regions/southwestern/LasConchasTrail/index.shtml">Las Conchas trail</a> is Rebecca's favorite). You have to see the incredible view of White Rock Canyon and the Rio Grande from <a href="https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/new-mexico/nm-hiking-trail-views/">Overlook Park</a>. The <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g28952-d210286-Reviews-Valle_Grande-New_Mexico.html">Valle Grande</a> in <a href="https://www.nps.gov/vall/index.htm">Valles Caldera National Preserve</a> is also a favorite scenic roadside spot (look for elk). If you want to take a roadtrip, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/chcu/index.htm">Chaco Culture National Historical Park</a> is worth the three-hour drive. You could also visit <a href="https://www.nps.gov/whsa/index.htm">White Sands National Park</a> (America's newest national park) in southern New Mexico or go all the way to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/cave/index.htm">Carlsbad Caverns</a> near the Texas border.

			<a href="https://santafe.org/">Santa Fe</a> offers art museums and galleries, great food, historic sites, and, of course, <a href="https://meowwolf.com/">Meow Wolf</a>. Los Alamos is part of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/mapr/manhattan-project-los-alamos.htm">Manhattan Project National Historical Park</a>, commemorating the effort to build the first nuclear bombs during WWII. You can't visit the national laboratory where we work today (sorry guys), but Benigno suggests you should check out the <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/museum/">Bradbury Science Museum</a> in town.</p>
			<p>
			<del>The world-famous <a href="https://balloonfiesta.com/">Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta</a> (October 3-11) also coincides with the week of our wedding.</del>
